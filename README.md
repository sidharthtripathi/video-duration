# video-duration
A program built in node to get the length of playlist  

# To run the program  
-> open cmd `` npm install ``  
-> open the main.js file and mention the path of file  
-> run script using `` npm run test ``  



# What's not working
- Absolute paths do not work as of now  
- works with mp4 files only ( though you can change it in modules.js file )
